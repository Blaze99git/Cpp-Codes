Degree of Polynomial

In mathematics, the degree of polynomials in one variable is the highest power of the variable in the algebraic expression with non-zero coefficient.

Chef has a polynomial in one variable xx with NN terms. The polynomial looks like A0⋅x0+A1⋅x1+…+AN−2⋅xN−2+AN−1⋅xN−1A0​⋅x0+A1​⋅x1+…+AN−2​⋅xN−2+AN−1​⋅xN−1 where Ai−1Ai−1​ denotes the coefficient of the ithith term xi−1xi−1 for all (1≤i≤N)(1≤i≤N).

Find the degree of the polynomial.

Note: It is guaranteed that there exists at least one term with non-zero coefficient.
Input Format

    First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
    First line of each test case contains of a single integer NN - the number of terms in the polynomial.
    Second line of each test case contains of NN space-separated integers - the ithith integer Ai−1Ai−1​ corresponds to the coefficient of xi−1xi−1.

Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line, the degree of the polynomial.

Explanation:

Test case 11: There is only one term x0x0 with coefficient 55. Thus, we are given a constant polynomial and the degree is 00.

Test case 22: The polynomial is −3⋅x0+3⋅x1=−3+3⋅x−3⋅x0+3⋅x1=−3+3⋅x. Thus, the highest power of xx with non-zero coefficient is 11.

Test case 33: The polynomial is 0⋅x0+0⋅x1+5⋅x2=0+0+5⋅x20⋅x0+0⋅x1+5⋅x2=0+0+5⋅x2. Thus, the highest power of xx with non-zero coefficient is 22.

Test case 44: The polynomial is 1⋅x0+2⋅x1+4⋅x2+0⋅x3=1+2⋅x+4⋅x21⋅x0+2⋅x1+4⋅x2+0⋅x3=1+2⋅x+4⋅x2. Thus, the highest power of xx with non-zero coefficient is 22.





Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t, n;
    
    // Input the number of test cases
    cin >> t;
    
    while (t--) {
        // Input the number of terms in the polynomial
        cin >> n;
        
        // Declare an array to store the coefficients of the polynomial
        int arr[n];
        
        // Input the coefficients of the polynomial
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> arr[i];
        }
        
        // Loop from the last term to the first term to find the highest power with a non-zero coefficient
        for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            // If the coefficient is non-zero, print the index (degree of the polynomial) and break the loop
            if (arr[j] != 0) {
                cout << j << endl;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
